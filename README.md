Hi, everyone. I am glad to introduce my version of your test task solving.
So, we have a simple React application, that sending POST requests to some back-end. When you starting app, you have 3 fields: dish name (text field), preparation time (formatted data like 00:00:00) and slelct field of the dish type. Dish type can be one of the 3 string: pizza, soup and sandwich. When you make a desision of type, app render additional fields for your form (different for every type). After filling out the form, request send as POST to the back. If request was fullfiled, react-hot-toast show you message. But if your request was rejected, react-hot-toast whatever show you message, but now as an error message. 
For this apps I used Redux Toolkit (for its simplicity and declarativeness). Sorry, but as the form I used Formik with yup validation. These libraries are newer, than the Redux-Form, and I have experiense with these libraries yet. Especially Redux-Form is no longer maintained by its author, as I know. For basicaly styling components I used Styled-components.
